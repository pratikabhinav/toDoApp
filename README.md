# toDoApp
A simple todo list app built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although designed for mobile viewing, you can view the app on any device and the responsiveness of the app will ensure adaptive viewing experience.

The data is stored locally in JSON format which ensures persistence of the tasks even after you close the tab or reload the page. The fist section of the app lists the pending tasks and the second section has all the tasks you have already completed.

The working app is hosted using Firebase hosting, and the same can be found at <a href="https://todoapp-127fc.firebaseapp.com">this link</a>
